		<div class="project--body">
			<p>
				The initial idea with this project was to create a football score predictor. While looking for resources
				where I could get data to train my model I got a little sidetracked. I stumbled upon a website that gave
				odds from different bookmakers. That's where I noticed something interesting (leading to my
				sidetracking). It was possible to make risk-free bets - Arbitrage Betting. Basically, you can bet on all
				outcomes, leveraging the odds of different bookmakers to minimize or even eliminate any potential
				losses. Of course, some scenarios would pay out more than others, and it was not possible for all games.
				But for me this was an interesting enough concept, I had to find a way to take advantage of.
			</p>
			<p>
				So my predictor app transformed into an odds analyser. Using TagUI to do some Robotic Process
				Automation, I would scrape the site for the odds of all the matches of the day and save the data in a
				CSV file. I would then run a Python script to calculate the output of placing my bets using this
				arbitrage betting technique. This updated data would be saved to another CSV file and uploaded to Google
				Drive. I would then receive a notification through Telegram and email. At a certain time an event would
				be fired and the file would be formatted in Google Sheets to present the best games for me to bet on. I
				would again be notified through Telegram and email when this was done.

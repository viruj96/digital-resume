		<h1>Digitizing Daily Workflow</h1>

		<div class="project--body">
			<p>
				The Geotechnical Investigation for a construction project is an important part of the design process. The
				purpose of the investigation is to gather information about the subsurface conditions at the project site.
				This information is used to assess the risks associated with the proposed construction project. The
				investigation includes a variety of activities, such as drilling, soil sampling, and laboratory testing.
			</p>
			<p>
				During geotechnical investigations, crews may spend days onsite conducting tests and inspections. By
				understanding the detailed geology and soils at the site, engineers can determine the best course of action
				for stabilizing the site. By grounding their findings in data, they can make informed decisions about the
				type and amount of construction necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main issue with this process is the amount of time it takes from the gathering of the data to its
				analysis and interpretation. Foremen would manually log all data gathered during the investigation. This
				could be the depths of the soil drilled or the test results. Only at the end of the investigation would the
				data be sent back to the engineering office for further analysis. Or daily trips would be made to send
				whatever data was collected to the laboratory.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, I was tasked with optimizing this process. I did not have the expertise to automatically log the data
				but I managed to make changes to the transfer of data and simplify the logging. I developed an Excel
				application using VBA for the foremen to log their data.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The type of work to be conducted is chosen and the app adapts accordingly</li>
				<li>Repeated entries like date and name of operators are only entered once</li>
				<li>The foremen can focus on the data recorded and test results</li>
				<li>At the end of the day the foreman can send the data to the engineering office</li>
			</ul>

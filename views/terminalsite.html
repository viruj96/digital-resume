				For some time now I've been meaning to make a personal portfolio. I am not the most creative person and
				so never had a solid idea of how I would do it. There are many great examples out there and I did take
				inspiration from a few. But why it took me so long despite so many ideas is the complexity of these
				projects. Looking at other people's portfolios is intimidating 😓. I know I shouldn't be but looking at
				what's possible and having little to no idea how to do it does not help!
			</p>
			<p>
				I like to play around a lot with the CLI and by some stroke of luck fell on some YouTube videos on
				terminal-themed websites. So I thought why not make one myself? It might not be the flashiest of
				portfolios and definitely not perfect but I had fun making it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initially, I planned making it using qwik after hearing so much about it. I gave it a shot and although
				it isn't hard to grasp I had some trouble with the event listeners. So I gave up a little too easily on
				it and decided to build it in svelte. I have some experience with react and solid js but not much in
				svelte. Thought this would be a great opportunity to learn it and it was.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now it wasn't all as smooth as I'd hoped but I managed to make something from the ground up and finally
				got a better understanding of this framework. Using a framework was a little overkill for this type of
				project I feel. It definitely would have been a lot simpler if I did it using vanilla js. But it was a
				great learning experience and I had fun 😁!
